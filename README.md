Test your RESTful Rails controllers with ease.

### Motivation

In every Rails app we have a set of controllers which encapsulates simple CRUD logic, especially in the admin area. Most of such controllers stays uncovered: it often seems excessive to test typical things. In other hand, in such typical places there always exists some unusual logic, which had to be tested. Furthermore, 100% test coverage rocks.

## Simple Use Case

Given we have [typical REST controller](spec/dummy/app/controllers/users_controller.rb).

It can be tested with a few lines of code:

```ruby
include_context "ResourceSpec", User do
  it_behaves_like "GET :new"
  it_behaves_like "POST :create"
  it_behaves_like "GET :edit"
  it_behaves_like "PUT :update"
  it_behaves_like "DELETE :destroy"
  it_behaves_like "GET :index"
end
```

`FactoryGirl` factory for `User` must be defined. Calls to `FactoryGirl` or other factory engine can be overridden with settings.

## Customization

Take a look at [default settings](lib/resource_spec/context.rb). All of these settings can be changed inside `include_context` block.

Some examples:

### Redirect to `#index` instead of `#show` on create

Define override context somewhere in `support` folder:

```ruby
RSpec.shared_context "ResourceSpec overrides" do
  let(:success_resource_url) { controller.url_for(action: :index) }
end
```

Then include:

```ruby
include_context "ResourceSpec", User do
  include_context "ResourceSpec overrides"

  ...
end
```

### Nesting

This will make nested resources like `/category/:category_id/groups` work:

```ruby
  let(:category) { create(:category) }

  include_context "ResourceSpec", Group do
    let(:base_url_args) { { category_id: category.id } }

    ...
  end
```

### Skipping passwords

`POST :create` and `PUT :update` examples are checking the record on compliance between params passed by request and record values saved to database. Some fields like images, generated tokens, encrypted passwords must be skipped.

```ruby
include_context "ResourceSpec", User do
  let(:not_expected_params) do
    %i(password password_confirmation last_sign_in_at)
  end

  ...
end

```

### Timestamps

If you have any DateTime fields in your model - freeze the time:

```ruby
around { |example| travel_to(Time.now, &example) }
```

If you have Date columns - use `#to_date` in factory.

### Additional action expectations

```ruby
include_context "ResourceSpec", User do
  it_behaves_like "GET :new" do
    it "includes form tag" do
      expect(response.body).to include("form")
    end
  end
  ...
end
```

### XHR

```ruby
include_context "ResourceSpec", User do
  it_behaves_like "POST :create", xhr: true
  it_behaves_like "PUT :update", xhr: true
  it_behaves_like "DELETE :destroy", xhr: true
end
```

### Paranoia on destroy

```ruby
include_context "ResourceSpec", User do
  it_behaves_like "DELETE :destroy", paranoid: true
end
```

## Using shared example groups separately

Sometimes you do not need all the default flow in your spec. You can use just that expectations that you need. Here is the example from one of the real projects:

```ruby
describe "updating collection" do
  include_context "ResourceSpec", Collection

  let(:resource) { controller.collection }
  let(:instance) { create(:collection, :with_items, user: user }

  it_behaves_like "PUT :update, success", xhr: true

  describe "PUT :update, fail" do
    let(:url_args) { invalid_update_url_args }

    # Special case: model validations are external.
    before { allow(controller.form).to receive(:save).and_return(false) }

    include_examples "send PUT :update", xhr: true
    include_examples "responds with failure", xhr: true
  end
end
```

Take a look on [shared examples](lib/resource_spec/shared.rb) we have.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "resource_spec"
```

And this to `spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require "resource_spec/all"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install resource_spec

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
